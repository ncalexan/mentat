  "Evolve a map of generations {:upserts-e [...], :upserts-ev [...], ...} as much as possible.

  The algorithm is as follows.

  First, resolve :upserts-e against the database.  Some [a v] -> e will upsert; some will not.
  Some :upserts-e evolve to become actual :upserts (they upserted!); any other :upserts-e evolve to
  become :allocations-e (they did not upsert, and will not upsert this transaction).  All :upserts-e
  will evolve out of the :upserts-e generation: each one upserts or does not.

  Using the newly upserted id-literals, some :upserts-ev evolve to become :resolved;
  some :upserts-ev evolve to become :upserts-e; and some :upserts-ev remain :upserts-ev.

  Likewise, some :allocations-ev evolve to become :allocations-e, :allocations-v, or :resolved; some
  :allocations-e evolve to become :resolved; and some :allocations-v evolve to become :resolved.

  If we have *new* :upserts-e (i.e., some :upserts-ev become :upserts-e), then we may be able to
  make more progress.  We recurse, trying to resolve these new :upserts-e.

  Eventually we will have no :upserts-e.  At this point, :upserts-ev become :allocations-ev, and now
  we have :entities, :upserted, :resolved, and various :allocations-*.

  As a future optimization, :upserts do not need to be inserted; they upserted, so they already
  exist in the DB.  (We still need to verify uniqueness and ensure no overlapping can occur.)
  Similarly, :allocations-* do not need to be checked for existence, so they can be written to the DB
  faster."

  It's worth noting that some amount of trial and error is probably

  It's my belief that no graph algorithm can correctly order the
  id-literals in quasi-linear time, since that algorithm will need to
  accept all permutations of the id-literals.  Therefore, we simplify
  by accepting that we may process the input multiple times, and we
  regain some efficiency by sorting so that upserts happen earlier and
  we are most likely to find a successful entid allocation without
  multiple trials.

  Concretely, we sort [-1 a v] < [-1 a -2] < [e a -1] < [e a v].  This
  means simple upserts will be processed early, followed by entities
  with multiple id-literals that we hope will reduce to simple upserts
  based on the earlier upserts.  After that, we handle what should be
  simple allocations."
